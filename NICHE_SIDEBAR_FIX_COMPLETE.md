# Tango CRM - Niche Sidebar Display Fix Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solved**

**Issue**: After a user successfully completes the payment flow (including with discount codes), the newly purchased niche was not appearing in the sidebar for use.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Webhook Race Condition**: Frontend redirected before database update completed
2. **Cache Invalidation**: Payment status cache wasn't properly cleared after payments
3. **Discount Code Handling**: Webhook didn't specifically handle discounted/free payments
4. **Frontend State Sync**: Sidebar didn't immediately refresh user data after payment success

## âœ… **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. **Enhanced Stripe Webhook Handler** (`src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`)

**Key Improvements**:
- **Discount Code Detection**: Added logic to detect discounted and free payments
- **Payment Analysis**: Enhanced logging to track payment amounts and discount status
- **Free Payment Handling**: Set subscription status to 'active' for free/discounted payments without subscriptions
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error logging and fallback mechanisms

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Check if this is a discounted or free payment
const isDiscountedPayment = (session.total_details?.amount_discount || 0) > 0;
const isFreePayment = session.amount_total === 0;

// For free or discounted payments without subscription, set status to active
if (isFreePayment || isDiscountedPayment) {
  await userOperations.updateProfile(userId, {
    subscription_status: 'active',
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Payment Status Hook** (`src/hooks/use-payment-status.ts`)

**Key Improvements**:
- **Force Refresh Method**: Added `forceRefreshAfterPayment()` method
- **Cache Management**: Better cache invalidation and clearing
- **Background Refresh**: Silent refresh capabilities for better UX

**New Method**:
```typescript
const forceRefreshAfterPayment = async () => {
  // Clear cache immediately
  clearCache()
  
  // Wait for webhook to process
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))
  
  // Use force refresh endpoint
  const response = await fetch('/api/user/force-refresh-payment-status', {
    method: 'POST',
    cache: 'no-cache'
  });
}
```

### 3. **New Force Refresh API Endpoint** (`src/app/api/user/force-refresh-payment-status/route.ts`)

**Purpose**: Dedicated endpoint to force refresh payment status and clear cache

**Features**:
- **Direct Stripe Check**: Forces check against Stripe API for latest data
- **Database Sync**: Updates database with correct subscription status
- **Cache Busting**: Ensures fresh data is returned
- **Admin Support**: Handles admin users appropriately

### 4. **Enhanced Dashboard Polling** (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Key Improvements**:
- **Payment Success Detection**: Detects when user comes from payment success page
- **Automatic Polling**: Polls payment status every 3 seconds for up to 30 seconds
- **Smart Stopping**: Stops polling when payment status is confirmed
- **Force Refresh**: Triggers force refresh when payment is confirmed

**Polling Logic**:
```typescript
// Poll every 3 seconds for up to 30 seconds
const pollInterval = setInterval(async () => {
  const data = await fetch('/api/user/payment-status?t=' + Date.now());
  
  // If we have niches and active subscription, stop polling
  if (data.niches && data.niches.length > 0 && data.hasActiveSubscription) {
    clearInterval(pollInterval);
    forceRefreshAfterPayment();
  }
}, 3000);
```

### 5. **Enhanced Onboarding Success Page** (`src/app/onboarding/success/page.tsx`)

**Key Improvements**:
- **Force Refresh After Niche Addition**: Clears cache after adding specific niches
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error logging and fallback mechanisms
- **Payment Status Sync**: Ensures payment status is refreshed after niche addition

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Case 1: Regular Payment Flow**
1. User completes onboarding
2. User makes full-price payment
3. **Expected**: New niche appears in sidebar immediately

### **Test Case 2: Discount Code Payment**
1. User applies discount code during checkout
2. User completes discounted payment
3. **Expected**: New niche appears in sidebar immediately

### **Test Case 3: 100% Discount (Free)**
1. User applies 100% discount code
2. User completes $0 payment
3. **Expected**: New niche appears in sidebar immediately

### **Test Case 4: Niche Upgrade Flow**
1. User clicks "Add Niche" in sidebar
2. User selects specific niche and pays
3. **Expected**: New niche appears in sidebar immediately

### **Test Case 5: Multiple Niche Purchases**
1. User purchases first niche
2. User purchases additional niche
3. **Expected**: All purchased niches appear in sidebar

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Webhook Event Flow**:
1. Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` event
2. Webhook processes payment and updates database
3. Webhook sets subscription status based on payment type
4. Cache is marked for invalidation

### **Frontend Update Flow**:
1. User redirects to dashboard from payment success
2. Dashboard detects payment success referrer
3. Dashboard starts polling payment status
4. When payment confirmed, force refresh is triggered
5. Sidebar updates with new niche

### **Cache Management**:
1. Payment status cache is cleared on force refresh
2. New data is fetched with cache-busting parameters
3. Cache is updated with fresh data
4. UI components re-render with updated data

## ðŸ“Š **Monitoring & Debugging**

### **Key Log Messages to Monitor**:
- `ðŸ”§ Processing webhook event: checkout.session.completed`
- `ðŸ”§ Payment analysis: { isDiscountedPayment, isFreePayment }`
- `âœ… Webhook: Set subscription status to active for free/discounted payment`
- `ðŸ”§ Force refreshing payment status after payment success...`
- `ðŸ”§ Polling payment status (1/10)...`
- `âœ… Payment status updated successfully, stopping poll`

### **Error Handling**:
- Webhook errors are logged with full context
- Frontend polling has fallback mechanisms
- Cache failures trigger direct API calls
- Network errors are handled gracefully
