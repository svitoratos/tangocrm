# Creator Niche Upgrade - Complete Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective Achieved**
Successfully implemented creator niche upgrade with both monthly and yearly payment links that immediately unlock the creator dashboard after successful payment.

### **Step 1: User Initiates Upgrade**
1. User clicks "Add Niche" in sidebar
2. Upgrade modal opens with niche selection
3. User selects "Creator" niche
4. User selects billing cycle (Monthly or Yearly)

### **Step 2: Payment Processing**
1. System detects creator niche + billing cycle selection
2. Redirects to specific payment link based on billing cycle:

   - **Yearly**: `https://buy.stripe.com/7sY6oI6p44U3gZGgWM2Nq07`
3. User completes payment on Stripe

### **Step 3: Payment Success**
1. Stripe redirects to `/payment-success`
2. Payment success page detects creator payment links
3. Redirects to `/onboarding/success` with creator metadata

### **Step 4: Niche Addition**
1. Onboarding success page adds creator niche to user account
2. Updates user's niches array: `['podcaster', 'creator']` â†’ `['podcaster', 'creator', 'creator']`
3. Sets subscription status to active

### **Step 5: Dashboard Access**
1. Redirects to creator dashboard: `/dashboard?niche=creator&section=dashboard`
2. User immediately sees creator dashboard
3. Creator niche appears in sidebar dropdown

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Payment Links**
- **Monthly**: https://buy.stripe.com/fZu14o7t83PZeRy35W2Nq06
- **Yearly**: https://buy.stripe.com/7sY6oI6p44U3gZGgWM2Nq07

### **Code Changes**

#### **1. Niche Upgrade Modal (`src/components/app/niche-upgrade-modal.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Special handling for creator niche - use the specific payment links
if (selectedNiche === 'creator') {
  if (billingCycle === 'monthly') {
    console.log('ðŸ”§ Using specific creator monthly payment link');
    window.location.href = 'https://buy.stripe.com/fZu14o7t83PZeRy35W2Nq06';
  } else if (billingCycle === 'yearly') {
    console.log('ðŸ”§ Using specific creator yearly payment link');
    window.location.href = 'https://buy.stripe.com/7sY6oI6p44U3gZGgWM2Nq07';
  }
  onClose();
  return;
}
```

#### **2. Payment Success Detection (`src/app/payment-success/page.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Check if user came from the creator payment links
const referrer = document.referrer;
if (referrer.includes('buy.stripe.com/fZu14o7t83PZeRy35W2Nq06') || 
    referrer.includes('buy.stripe.com/7sY6oI6p44U3gZGgWM2Nq07')) {
  console.log('ðŸ”§ Detected creator niche payment link, adding creator niche');
  router.push('/onboarding/success?upgrade=true&niche=creator&niches=%5B%22creator%22%5D&specific_niche=creator');
}
```

#### **3. Creator Dashboard Redirect (`src/app/onboarding/success/page.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Special handling for creator niche - immediately switch to creator dashboard
if (finalNiche === 'creator' || specificNiche === 'creator') {
  console.log('ðŸŽ¯ Redirecting to creator dashboard...');
  router.push('/dashboard?niche=creator&section=dashboard&upgrade=success');
}
```

## ðŸ”„ **Integration with Existing System**

This implementation follows the same pattern as the coach niche upgrade:
- Uses specific payment links instead of dynamic API
- Detects payment links via referrer
- Adds niche to user account automatically
- Redirects to appropriate dashboard immediately
- Maintains consistency with existing upgrade flow

The system now supports both coach and creator niche upgrades with dedicated payment links for each billing cycle.
