<website_design>
This niche-based CRM platform combines a sophisticated landing page with a comprehensive SaaS application interface. The landing page showcases the platform's multi-niche capabilities with a professional yet vibrant design, while the main application provides a monday.com-inspired interface tailored for creators, coaches, podcasters, and freelancers.

The website opens with a modern hero section featuring a clean navigation bar and compelling messaging about niche-specific CRM solutions. The hero includes a prominent product screenshot showing the customizable dashboard interface. Following sections demonstrate key features through interactive elements, showcase different niche customizations, present pricing tiers, and conclude with social proof and a call-to-action.

The main application interface centers around a collapsible sidebar navigation system with primary sections: Dashboard, CRM, Calendar, Analytics, and Programs/Content (dynamically labeled based on selected niche). The dashboard presents a grid of metric cards specific to each niche, with real-time statistics and filtering capabilities. The CRM section features drag-and-drop pipeline management with 10 customizable stages per niche, opportunity cards with rich field editing through modals, and advanced filtering systems.

The calendar integrates seamlessly with CRM data, showing niche-specific scheduling logic and task management. Analytics provides comprehensive reporting with niche-isolated data and easy sharing capabilities. The Programs/Content section adapts its interface based on the selected niche (showing "Programs" for coaches, "Content" for creators, etc.).

All components work together through a modular design system supporting multiple niches per user, with clear visual differentiation and easy switching between niche contexts. The interface maintains monday.com's familiar patterns while introducing niche-specific customizations and a more vibrant, creator-friendly aesthetic.
