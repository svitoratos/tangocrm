```

#### **3. Freelancer Dashboard Redirect (`src/app/onboarding/success/page.tsx`)**

This implementation follows the same pattern as the coach, creator, and podcaster niche upgrades:
- Uses specific payment links instead of dynamic API

- Redirects to appropriate dashboard immediately
- Maintains consistency with existing upgrade flow

The system now supports coach, creator, podcaster, and freelancer niche upgrades with dedicated payment links for each billing cycle.
